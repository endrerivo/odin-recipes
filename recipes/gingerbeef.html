   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>In looking for a healthier version of the standard ginger beef, I came up with this non-deep fried version. 
    The longer you marinate the beef, the more ginger flavor it soaks up. </p>
   
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>1 pound round steak, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
    <li>...</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Place steak, ginger, and soy sauce in a bowl; turn to coat steak. Cover tightly; marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.</li>
    <li>Heat a wok over high heat; pour in beef mixture. Cover wok; cook until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. Remove beef from wok.</li>
    <li>Heat butter in wok over high heat; stir in bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, and sweet and sour sauce. Cover and cook until vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes. 
        Stir cooked beef into vegetable mixture; cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve over cooked rice.</li>
   </ol>
